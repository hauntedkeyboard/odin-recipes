    <p>There's nothing quite like homemade cherry pie – this easy version is topped with a pastry lid. Serve with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. Don't forget to shed a tear.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g/5oz good-quality black cherry jam</li>
        <li>100ml/3½fl oz water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground arrowroot, mixed to a paste with 2 tbsp water</li>
        <li>750g/1½lb fresh red cherries, stalks and stones removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the pie filling, heat the cherry jam and water in a pan over a low heat, stirring continuously, until the jam has melted and is starting to bubble.</li>
        <li>Add the arrowroot mixture and stir to combine. Continue to simmer the mixture until the sauce is very thick and smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the cherries and stir carefully to coat them in the hot jam mixture. Transfer the filling mixture to a 1 litre/1¾ pint pie dish (they should reach just above the rim of the dish). Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>For the pastry, pulse the flour, butter and sugar together in a food processor until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>That's quite enough, you hear about most of these ingredients for the first time, AND you're too sad to continue.</li>           
    </ol>
